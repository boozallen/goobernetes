# Contribution Guidelines

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

## I found a problem in the documents

Please open an issue and tell us what's going wrong.  Regardless of if you fixed it yourself or you still need help, we need to know the documentation isn't correct.

## I fixed or added something

Thanks! Please open a pull request so we can review it.

## Okay, I really want to fix/add something, but I just don't know how

No problem!  We collaborate together using the normal [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) of forking, making the changes, doing a pull request, and merging back in to this, the main branch.  Let's break it down:

1. Forking - This makes your own personal copy of this repository to work on.

1. Making the changes - You can do this however you'd like to, but when you are done, move to the next step which is

1. Doing a pull request - This lets the maintainer know you have something to contribute to the main copy (called a branch).  There can be some discussion and other changes that happen at this point too.

1. Merging - This brings your changes back into the main branch and available for everyone to enjoy!

All of this documentation is written in [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).  It's a super-simple way to make text  display nicely in a browser.

If you're contributing pictures, we ask that they be of a reasonable size and resolution, saved as a JPG file.
